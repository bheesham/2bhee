I'm a student who currently attends [Carleton University][CU] and works for
[CENX]. I've worked as a Developer / Analyist for [Shared Services Canada][SSC]
and was a Research Assistant for the [Carleton Computer Security Lab][CCSL].

With the help of some wonderful people at the Carleton Computer Security Lab, I
published a paper on [the recombination of cryptographic libraries for software
diversity][ASIA2016].

I can be contacted at me <i class="fa fa-at"></i> bheesham.com. Here is the
fingerprint for the [GPG key][PGP] I sometimes use:
