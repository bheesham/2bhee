Welcome to my website.

I'm a Junior Software Developer currently working at [CENX]. I worked as a
Developer / Analyst for [Shared Services Canada][SSC] and was a Research
Assistant for the [Carleton Computer Security Lab][CCSL].

I graduated from [Carleton University][CU]'s Computer Science program. With the
help of some wonderful people at the Carleton Computer Security Lab, I published
a paper on
[the recombination of cryptographic libraries for software diversity][ASIA2016].
The paper is based on the research I did for [Anil Somayaji][SOMA], for what
would turn into [my honours thesis][THESIS].

All of this information is available on my [resume][RESUME] in greater detail.

I can be contacted at [me@bheesham.com][EMAIL]; the fingerprint for
the [GPG key][PGP] I sometimes use is:

```
4941 2C2A 783E 30B2 DE84  D2ED 3361 7817 D589 CB73
```

### Web presence

  * [GitHub][GH] is where I put most of my code.
  * [Twitter][TW] is where I sporadically share things.
  * [LinkedIn][LI] is where I try to seem like I'm professional.
  * [Pinboard][PB] is where I keep a list of sites I find interesting.
  * [Steamed Pears][SP] is an umbrella moniker for miscellaneous projects.
