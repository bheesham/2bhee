I've finally done something I've wanted to do for a long time now: write my own
input agnostic blogging engine (read as: experiment with Pandoc).

Over the years I've grown pretty used to writing \(\LaTeX\), and now at work I
find myself using Org-mode a whole lot to organize my thoughts.

Why not get the best of all worlds?
